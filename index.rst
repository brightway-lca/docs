Brightway: Modular & open framework for Life Cycle Assessment
=============================================================

Brightway is a set of components for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), designed to play nicely with each other but also be powerful on their own.

This documentation is for Brightway version 3, a near-complete rewrite of Brightway2, designed to make it easier and simpler to use, and ready for cloud computing. There is a whole section of the docs on the :ref:`differences with version 2 <intro-version-3>`.

Who is Brightway for?
---------------------

Brightway doesnâ€™t try to replace software like SimaPro or OpenLCA, but rather to offer new possibilities to those who want to break the limits of conventional LCA. So it's not for everyone, and you will need to invest some time learning about Python. However, it also opens up numerous possibilities; here are some recent published examples:

* `Fast dynamic LCA with custom convolution functions`_
* `Linking parameterized LCA with building energy models`_
* `Developing matrix-based methods for regionalized LCA`_
* `Screening and global sensitivity testing with large LCA databases`_
* `Incorporating LCA into manufacturing process models`_
